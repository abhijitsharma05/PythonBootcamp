Problem Statement

You are asked to design a Flight Management System in Python using exception handling.
 
The system should:

- Read flight information from a file called flights.txt.

- Each line has: flight_number available_seats price_per_ticket

  Example: AI101 50 6000
 
Ask the user for:

- Flight number

- Number of tickets to book
 
Implement the following exception rules: (Questions below)
 
(a) Raise FlightNotFoundError (custom) if the entered flight number does not exist.
 
(b) Raise SeatsUnavailableError (custom) if requested tickets exceed available seats.
 
(c) Handle ValueError if user enters invalid input (like string instead of integer).
 
(d) Handle ZeroDivisionError if user enters 0 tickets (while calculating discount per ticket).
 
(e) Always close the file using finally.
 
The program should print:

- Flight details

- Total booking cost

- Discount per ticket (total / tickets)
 
Note**:

Use nested try-except:
 
Inner block for booking operations.
 
Outer block for file handling & re-raised exceptions
